Project Overview:

This project focuses on classifying emotions in text data, a critical task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with significant implications in digital communications, mental health analysis, and personalized services. We explored a variety of models, ranging from traditional machine learning techniques to advanced deep learning architectures. The study also involved thorough data preprocessing and augmentation to address dataset imbalances, enhancing the robustness of our models.

Abstract:

Understanding emotions in text is essential for various applications, including customer reviews, social media analysis, and mental health studies. This project aimed to classify emotions into six categories: anger, fear, surprise, joy, sadness, and love. We employed models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Tiny BERT. Our study utilized the "Emotions Dataset for NLP" obtained from Kaggle and involved meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation techniques.
